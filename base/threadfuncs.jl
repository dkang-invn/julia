    Threads.foreach(f, channel::Channel; ntasks=Threads.nthreads(),
                    schedule=:fair)

Similar to `foreach(f, channel)`, but iteration over `channel` and calls to
`f` are split across `ntasks` tasks spawned by `Threads.@spawn`. This function
will wait for all internally spawned tasks to complete before returning.

If `schedule` is `:fair`, `Threads.foreach` will spawn a new task for each work
item, allowing Julia's scheduler to more freely load-balance work items across
threads. Technically, in `:fair` mode, `Threads.foreach` may execute up to
`2 * ntasks` tasks concurrently.

If `schedule` is `:static`, `Threads.foreach` will simply spawn `ntasks` tasks
such that each task is locked to the thread it was spawned on. This approach has
lower scheduling overhead and thus may be more suitable for more uniform,
fine-grained workloads.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.
